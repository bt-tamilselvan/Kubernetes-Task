Task: Set Up VPC, Subnets, and Launch EC2 Instance
Task Description:
Set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with an Internet Gateway.
Create a Public Subnet with 256 IP addresses using the CIDR block 192.168.0.0/24.
Create a Private Subnet with 256 IP addresses using the CIDR block 192.168.1.0/24.
Create a Route Table to connect the Internet Gateway and the subnets.
Launch a Linux EC2 Instance in the public subnet of the VPC.
Tech Stacks Used:
AWS VPC
AWS EC2
Steps:
1. Create the VPC
Go to the VPC Dashboard in the AWS Console.
Create a new VPC with the CIDR block 192.168.0.0/16.
Create an Internet Gateway and attach it to the VPC.
2. Create the Subnets
Public Subnet: Create a public subnet with CIDR block 192.168.0.0/24.
Private Subnet: Create a private subnet with CIDR block 192.168.1.0/24.
3. Create the Route Table
Create a Route Table for the public subnet.
Add a route 0.0.0.0/0 pointing to the Internet Gateway.
Associate the route table with the public subnet.
4. Launch EC2 Instance
In the EC2 Dashboard, launch a Linux EC2 instance.
Ensure the instance is launched in the public subnet of the created VPC.
Associate a public IP address with the instance.
5. Test Connectivity
Access the EC2 instance via SSH using the private key.
6. Push Work to GitHub
